# Story of this game 📖


This project was developed for one of my clients as part of their game development. As a freelancer, I was tasked with completing one of their games by implementing a Simple Bounce Mechanic to add more dynamic interactions. The core mechanics of movement, rotation, and bouncing were essential for the gameplay experience.

The project allowed me to refine my understanding of Unity's physics system and its capabilities for creating simple yet engaging mechanics. It was a great opportunity to contribute to a client's project while honing my skills.
